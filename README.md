CS Student @ NYU
----------------

I’m a senior at New York University studying Computer Science and Mathematics, with a passion for backend development and large-scale systems. Recently, I interned as a Software Engineer @ LinkedIn, working on scalable distributed systems to power core data infrastructure, and prevously worked on optimized performance testing software @ Liberty Mutual. Right now, I’m also enjoying diving deeper into full-stack and web development :)

I’m excited about new grad software engineering opportunities and love building my skills through open-source contributions, internships, and personal projects!
